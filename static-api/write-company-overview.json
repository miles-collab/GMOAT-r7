  "companyOverview": "The company engineers recombinant proteins through a cell-free manufacturing platform that’s 10x faster than traditional fermentation. Their core tech enables rapid iteration and cost-effective scaling, initially targeting alternative meat and clean-label inputs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by a Cambridge PhD and former Ginkgo execs, the team has developed 3 functional protein candidates and established a commercial pilot with a $10B CPG. Their wedge is precision control at low batch volumes, unlocking niche use cases too small for fermentation.\n\nOne CPG R&D team described it as 'the first real plug-and-play platform for bio-based ingredients' — reducing prototyping cycles from months to weeks. The company is pre-revenue but has 4 paid pilots and is nearing its first LOI close."
